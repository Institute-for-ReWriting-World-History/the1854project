## A Note About This Book

> The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be
> translated as "seem good." Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all
> of these are dogmas for us today, just as the Godhead, the
> Resurrection, and spiritual grace were (and still are) dogmas for the
> christan community (Nisbet 22-23).[^3]

[^4]: Action—Which is associated with the consciousness of doer,
    instrument, and result.

    Knowledge—Of Non-duality.

    Ignorance—Which conjures up the multiplicity of the relative world.
    (See note on verse 5, p. 160). Ignorance must not be confused with
    illiteracy or absence of book-knowledge. Vedanta declares that the
    Knowledge of the non-duality of Brahman and Ātman is the only true
    Knowledge; all else is ignorance. Any trace of duality belongs to
    the state of ignorance. As such, the vision of a god or the
    experience of happiness in heaven belongs to the realm of ignorance
    (Swami Nikhilānand 157*)*.
