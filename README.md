## A Note About This Book

> The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be translated as "seem good."
> Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all of these are dogmas for us today, just as
> the Godhead, the Resurrection, and spiritual grace were (and still are)
> dogmas for the christan community (Nisbet 22-23).

## Epigraph 

असतो मा सद्गमय ।<br>

मृत्योर्माऽमृतं गमय ॥<br>
<br>
*asato mā sadgamaya,*<br>
*tamaso mā jyotirgamaya,*<br>
*mṛtyormā'mṛtaṃ gamaya.*<br>

From the unreal lead me to the real!<br>
From the darkness lead me to the light!<br>
From death lead me to immortality!<br>

## Preface 	

>Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple
>forms of constraint.  And it induces regular effects of power.  Each society
>has its regime of truth, its “general politics” of truth: that is, the types
>of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and
>instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means
>by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in
>the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying
>what counts as true (Foucault, *The Foucault reader* 72-73).
