## Dedication 

All mundane activity is a co-operative effort; so is this work which is hereby dedicated to my family members, relations, friends and the printers who helped in various ways in the completion of this project.

The object in writing this work is to acquaint and awaken the world public to its primordial Vedic Heritage of the times when human beings were not divided and packed into mutually hating, hissing and hitting national and religious compartments.  

Vedic culture regards the whole globe as a commom home and all beings (including animal and plant life) as one family. 

Hinduism is a modem residual, territorial synonym of primeval, ancient worldwide Vedic culture implying people residing in the Sindhu (pronounced Hindu) region, whose goal is to lead a virtuous life of renunciation and social service sans drugs, hot drinks and womanizing without being 
pinned down to any prophet or the prophet’s book.

Readers believing in such an ideal may help set up World Vedic Heritage Academies throughout the world. This work is also dedicated to that goal of freeing humanity from all forms of terror, torture, tyranny,treachery, trickery, taxation and temptation of so called religions and weld 
all people into a common harmonious, homogeneous, peaceful, cheerful, helpful fraternity.

5. The Unified Field Theory of History

## 5. The Unified Field Theory of History

This volume should rank as very unique in the entire range 
of world historical literature, because, so far as we can see, in 
modem times no one has presented a consistent, plausible, 
continuous, single-source account of world history. Each one has 
begun at some random point, discussed some chosen periods and 
topics of history and called it a day. 

Such treatment is symptomatic of the confusion that abounds 
in the minds of the intelligentsia regarding history. That confusion 
is multilateral. This volume is intended to remove that confusing 
haze from the reader’s mind and open before him a new vista 
of logical, systematic and thorough thinking in history. 

Theologians agree that despite diverse manifestations the 
immanent divinity is one. Likewise physicists agree that the seemingly 
diverse elements of the physical world emanate from a single source. 
That indicates that there is a certain common starting point for 
everything. Naturally history is no exception. History too had a 
single-source, one point beginning. That is to say the beginning 
of the cosmos and the start of humanity was not a random, freakish, 
spontaneous, wild growth of just anything, anytime, anywhere, 
anyhow. It was a planned and systematic beginning. This is what 
we call the Unified Field Theory of History. Consequently we believe 
that in modem times this volume is the first work to propound 
such a view. 

The world began millions of years ago with the Kruta Yuga 
(i.e. the ‘ready-made' era) with a complete, ready-made setting 
of human beings, plants and animals, with humanity rooted in 
Vedic culture and speaking Sanskrit. Thereafter, divinity kept 
aloof watching and umpiring the affairs of the world, even as people 
start a stage play or a field game, factory or business firm with 
fully-trained participants and thereafter keep away watching and 
umpiring the performance. 

All history must start from that metaphysical point. The present 
concept that man was born somewhere, somehow and that he 
developed one or more languages anyhow must no longer be regarded 
as rational. 

That single-source unity of humanity continued through three 
eras namely Kruta, Treta and Dwapar. Towards the end of the 
Dwapar Yuga came the nuclear and biological devastation of the 
Mahabharat war. 

The shattering effect of that unprecedented annihilation caused 
three main types of fragmentation. Administratively, the unitary 
world government was broken into regional states such as Syria, 
Assyria, Scythia, Babylonia, Egypt, India and China. Contrarily 
current historical texts assume that man evolved from a monkey 
he then developed a language and later he organized states like 
Babylonia and Syria. 

Theologically the Vedic pantheon was shared by breakway cults 
and creeds, with each swearing allegiance to some particular form 
of divinity. 

Linguistically, the teaching of Sanskrit throughout the world, 
having broken down, local mannerisms and corruptions of the 
ancient, primordial Sanskrit gave rise to various regional languages 
of Europe, Asia and Africa. That was how ancient Vedic unity broke 
up into the present cleavage in every sphere. 

Likewise the teaching of all Vedic sciences and arts such as 
architecture and Ayurveda (the Vedic science of medicine) suffered 
a severe setback because while their texts remained Sanskrit, the 
ancient sway of Sanskrit as the universal language having come 
to an end, those who could read or teach ancient Sanskrit texts, 
dwindled progressively. 

It was that catastrophe which ushered a dark age over the 
human world. Humanity became divided into sectors and pockets 
with some groups remaining cut off in distant regions, sinking 
to a state of primitive living. It is those which we regard today 
as the forest tribes or the backward communities such as the Red 
Indians of America or the aborigines, Maories of Australia and New 
Zealand. Other pockets of humanity were in a slightly better state 
of civilization. Yet humanity as a whole totally lost its great scientific 
and technological advancement of the Mahabharat era and was pushed 
back almost to square one to make a fresh start. 

Eversince though the Western world has caught up once again 
with some remarkable technological advancement yet that is about 
all that can be said on the credit side. Even there the Westerners 
have totally failed to resuscitate and recapture the lofty principles 
and standards of economical and painless prophylactic proficiency 
of Ayurved and the immaculate grandeur of Vedic architecture. 
Even in other fields such as theological unity, social cohesion, political 
and administrative unity, eradication of poverty and crime, ensuring 
unimpeded access to all parts of the world, eliminating sectional, 
sectarian and religious strife, modem society rates veiy low. The 
propagation of factional religions like Buddhism, Christianity and 
Islam have driven wedges in human society and plunged it into 
social and theological confusion. The Vedic moorings have been 
lost. Humanity today is in the hapless position of being thrown 
overboard from a wrecked Vedic ship to fend for itself in a dark, 
stormy, shark-infested sea of divisive selfish interests with each 
individual or group trying to outdo, undo or kill the others. 

It is this story which this volume unfolds, of how a once united 
world is being progressively (or regressively!) riven into ever smaller 
fiercer and more enmical factions. 

It is hoped, incidentally, that this Unified Field Theory of World 
History would help unite humanity once again in Vedic culture, 
in the universal teaching and speaking of Sanskrit, abandonment 
of all religious and political labels and treating the whole globe 
as one realm where man may once again move freely as in ancient 
times sans passport and sans visa. This way tuition in history 
will cease to be a mere academic exercise and will have a certain 
overwhelming social utility and purpose. 

This volume should also serve as an encyclopaedia of lost history. 
Several truths long remaining hidden and unknown have been salvaged 
and presented herein for the enlightenment of the world. 

This volume also points out that a mere study of historical 
records is of no use and does not make one a historian if along 
with that study one does not have a mind keen to know the truth 
and one is not courageous enough to speak it out from house-tops 
in the teeth of fierce opposition from various pressure groups. 

Though the subject matter of this volume is history, unlike 
others the reader won’t meet here a mere rehash of old events 
but an absolutely new narration of lost and unknown history, a 
plausible explanation of garbled and half-understood concepts and 
a fresh new research methodology. 

The evidence presented in this volume should be regarded not 
as exhaustive but only as indicative of a vast new, virgin field 
of research. 

Thousands of new research volumes containing such information 
countrywise, regionwise and language-wise will have to be published. 

For this great task it would be proper to found a World Vedic 
Heritage University or Academy to conduct research and tuition 
in this primordial human heritage.

## About the Author

P.N. OAK   
  
Born af 9.54 am. On March 2. 1917 in Indore (Central India).

The author, P.N. Oak having made some far-reaching discoveries in
history, is the founder president of the Institute for Rewriting World
History. His latest finding is that in pre-Christian times Vedic culture
and Sanskrit language held full sway throughout the world.

P.N Oak was bom in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family in which his father
talked to him only in Sanskrit, mother only in English, relations in
Marathi and town- folk in Hindi. That gave him fluency in those four
languages from childhood.

After obtaining his B.A. degree from Agra University and completing
M.A., LL. B, courses of the Bombay University, Oak worked for a year as
Tutor in English at the Fergusson College, Pune and later having joined
the army was posted to Singapore at the age of 24.

There, after British surrender, Oak was one of the organizers of the
Indian National Army, a director and commentator at the Free India
Radio, Saigon, and latter a co-worker of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

After the end of World War II, Oak hitch-hiked from Singapore to
Calcutta across the border jungles of several countries.

From 1947 to 1974 his profession has been mainly journalism having
worked on the editorial staffs of the Hindustan Times and the Statesman,
as a class I Officer in Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
Government of India, and as editor in the American Embassy’s information
service, all in New Delhi.

Around 1959, Oak developed a curious new insight into history which led
him to some stunning discoveries as a result of his absorbing hobby of
visiting historic sites. He then founded (June 14, 1964) the institute
for Rewriting Indian History and wrote several books (listed elsewhere
in this volume).

Oak’s historical acumen led him to discover further that even world
history has gone wrong. His discoveries havetherefore, outgrown the name
and scope of the Institute for Rewriting Indian History. Having
discovered that from time immemorial up to the Mahabharat War, Vedic
culture and Sanskrit pervaded the whole world.

Oak is keen to found a world Vedic Heritage University to educate the
world in the primordial Vedic unity of all humanity. To that end he
invites correspondence from all those willing to help.
