## A Note About This Book

> Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of
> multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power.
> Each society has its regime of truth, its “general politics” of truth:
> that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as
> true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish
> true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the
> techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth;
> the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true
> (Foucault, *The Foucault reader* 72-73).[^2]

## Preface 	

> The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be
> translated as "seem good." Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all
> of these are dogmas for us today, just as the Godhead, the
> Resurrection, and spiritual grace were (and still are) dogmas for the
> christan community (Nisbet 22-23).[^3]

## Epigraph 

> *Indology*: "The academic study of the languages, cultures, histories,
> and religions of the Indian subcontinent."[^4]
