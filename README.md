## Preface

>The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be translated
>as "seem good." Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all of these are
>dogmas for us today, just as the Godhead, the Resurrection, and spiritual
>grace were (and still are) dogmas for the christan community (Nisbet 22-23).

## Introduction or What is The Classical Prejudice

Excerpt From *Introduction To The Study Of The Hindu Doctrines*: The Classical Prejudice 
By Rene Guenon

</summary>

We have already indicated what we mean by the “classical prejudice”; 
it consists essentially in a  predisposition to attribute the origin 
of all civilization to the Greeks and Romans. It seems scarcely possible 
to account for this attitude except by means of the following explanation: 
because their own civilization hardly goes any further back than the Grasco-Roman 
period and derives for the most part from it, Westerners are led to 
believe that it must have been the same in every other case and they 
have difficulty in conceiving of the existence of entirely different and far more ancient 
civilizations; it might be said that they are mentally incapable of 
crossing the Mediterranean. Furthermore, the habit of speaking of “civilization” in the absolute, 
also contributes largely towards maintaining this prejudice. “Civilization,” 
understood in this way and regarded as one entity, is something that has never 
existed; in actual practice there have always been and there still 
are “civilizations.” Western civilization, with its special features, 
is simply one civilization among others, and what is so pompously called 
“the evolution of civilization” is nothing more than the development of that 
particular civilization from its comparatively recent origins, a development which is, moreover, far 
from having always proceeded by a regular and all-round “progress” : the remarks we have just made about 
the so-called Renaissance and its consequences could serve as a striking illustration of an intellectual retro- 
gres'sion which, furthermore, has gone on increasing down to the present time.

## The Enlightenment, The Slave Bible and The Regimes of Truth 	

>Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple
>forms of constraint.  And it induces regular effects of power.  Each society
>has its regime of truth, its “general politics” of truth: that is, the types
>of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and
>instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means
>by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in
>the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying
>what counts as true (Foucault, *The Foucault reader* 72-73).

## Conclusion or What is The Crisis of The Modern World

Excerpt From *The Crisis of The Modern World*: The Dark Age By René Guénon

</summary>

THE HINDU DOCTRINE teaches that a human cycle, to which it gives the name Manvantara, 
is divided into four periods marking so many stages during which the primordial spirituality 
becomes gradually more and more obscured; these are the same periods that the ancient traditions 
of the West called the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron Ages. We are now in the fourth age, 
the Kali-Yuga or ‘dark age’, and have been so already, it is said, for more than six thousand years, 
that is to say since a time far earlier than any known to ‘classical’ history. Since that time, 
the truths which were formerly within reach of all have become more and more hidden and inaccessible; 
those who possess them grow fewer and fewer, and although the treasure of ‘nonhuman’ 
(that is, supra-human) wisdom that was prior to all the ages can never be lost, it nevertheless 
becomes enveloped in more and more impenetrable veils, which hide it from men’s sight and make 
it extremely difficult to discover. This is why we find everywhere, under various symbols, 
the same theme of something that has been lost—at least to all appearances and as far as 
the outer world is concerned—and that those who aspire to true knowledge must rediscover; 
but it is also said that what is thus hidden will become visible again at the end of the 
cycle, which, because of the continuity binding all things together, will coincide with 
the beginning of a new cycle.
