## A Note About This Book

> The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be
> translated as "seem good." Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all
> of these are dogmas for us today, just as the Godhead, the
> Resurrection, and spiritual grace were (and still are) dogmas for the
> christan community (Nisbet 22-23).[^3]

[^1]: THE HINDU DOCTRINE teaches that a human cycle, to which it gives
    the name Manvantara, is divided into four periods marking so many
    stages during which the primordial spirituality becomes gradually
    more and more obscured; these are the same periods that the ancient
    traditions of the West called the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron
    Ages. We are now in the fourth age, the Kali-Yuga or ‘dark age’, and
    have been so already, it is said, for more than six thousand years,
    that is to say since a time far earlier than any known to
    ‘classical’ history. Since that time, the truths which were formerly
    within reach of all have become more and more hidden and
    inaccessible; those who possess them grow fewer and fewer, and
    although the treasure of ‘nonhuman’ (that is, supra-human) wisdom
    that was prior to all the ages can never be lost, it nevertheless
    becomes enveloped in more and more impenetrable veils, which hide it
    from men’s sight and make it extremely difficult to discover. This
    is why we find everywhere, under various symbols, the same theme of
    something that has been lost—at least to all appearances and as far
    as the outer world is concerned—and that those who aspire to true
    knowledge must rediscover; but it is also said that what is thus
    hidden will become visible again at the end of the cycle, which,
    because of the continuity binding all things together, will coincide
    with the beginning of a new cycle (Guénon 7).

[^2]: તન-મન-ધન a. n. \[See તન + મન + ધન\] Lit. The body, the mind, and
    one’s wealth. Hence, 2. All that one loves; the highest object of
    one’s ambition (Belsare, 577).

[^4]: Action—Which is associated with the consciousness of doer,
    instrument, and result.

    Knowledge—Of Non-duality.

    Ignorance—Which conjures up the multiplicity of the relative world.
    (See note on verse 5, p. 160). Ignorance must not be confused with
    illiteracy or absence of book-knowledge. Vedanta declares that the
    Knowledge of the non-duality of Brahman and Ātman is the only true
    Knowledge; all else is ignorance. Any trace of duality belongs to
    the state of ignorance. As such, the vision of a god or the
    experience of happiness in heaven belongs to the realm of ignorance
    (Swami Nikhilānand 157*)*.
