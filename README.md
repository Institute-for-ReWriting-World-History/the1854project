## A Note About This Book

> The word "dogma" comes from the Greek dok (ein) which may be
> translated as "seem good." Equality, justice, freedom, democracy, all
> of these are dogmas for us today, just as the Godhead, the
> Resurrection, and spiritual grace were (and still are) dogmas for the
> christan community (Nisbet 22-23).

> praise (Ved., Sāy. = stotra); a sacred text (especially a Mantra used
> as a spell for averting evil influences, forming a distinct class from

> v., is sometimes applied to the collec- tion of texts commonly called
> Atharva-veda); the mystic syllable Om \[cf. Manu II. 83\] (Sir Monier
> Monier-Williams 0689);”

[^2]: તન-મન-ધન a. n. \[See તન + મન + ધન\] Lit. The body, the mind, and
    one’s wealth. Hence, 2. All that one loves; the highest object of
    one’s ambition (Belsare 577).

[^3]: Action—Which is associated with the consciousness of doer,
    instrument, and result.

    Knowledge—Of Non-duality.

    Ignorance—Which conjures up the multiplicity of the relative world.
    (See note on verse 5, p. 160). Ignorance must not be confused with
    illiteracy or absence of book-knowledge. Vedanta declares that the
    Knowledge of the non-duality of Brahman and Ātman is the only true
    Knowledge; all else is ignorance. Any trace of duality belongs to
    the state of ignorance. As such, the vision of a god or the
    experience of happiness in heaven belongs to the realm of ignorance
    (Swami Nikhilānand 157).

[^4]: I was maybe fifteen or sixteen when I first came across the 
    date 1619. Whenever I think about that moment, my mind conjures 
    an image of glowing three-dimensional numbers rising from the page. 
    Of course, in reality, they were printed in plain black text on 
    the cheap page of a paperback. Still, while the numbers did not 
    literally glow, I remember sitting back in my chair and staring 
    at the date, a bit confused, thrown off-kilter by an exhilarating 
    revelation starting to sink in (Hannah-Jones xvii).
