> (while the gross creation existed). (_Bhāgavata Purāṇa_ 3.5.24)

[^2]: તન-મન-ધન a. n. \[See તન + મન + ધન\] Lit. The body, the mind, and
    one’s wealth. Hence, 2. All that one loves; the highest object of
    one’s ambition (Belsare 577).

[^3]: Action—Which is associated with the consciousness of doer,
    instrument, and result.

    Knowledge—Of Non-duality.

    Ignorance—Which conjures up the multiplicity of the relative world.
    (See note on verse 5, p. 160). Ignorance must not be confused with
    illiteracy or absence of book-knowledge. Vedanta declares that the
    Knowledge of the non-duality of Brahman and Ātman is the only true
    Knowledge; all else is ignorance. Any trace of duality belongs to
    the state of ignorance. As such, the vision of a god or the
    experience of happiness in heaven belongs to the realm of ignorance
    (Swami Nikhilānand 157).

[^4]: I was maybe fifteen or sixteen when I first came across the 
    date 1619. Whenever I think about that moment, my mind conjures 
    an image of glowing three-dimensional numbers rising from the page. 
    Of course, in reality, they were printed in plain black text on 
    the cheap page of a paperback. Still, while the numbers did not 
    literally glow, I remember sitting back in my chair and staring 
    at the date, a bit confused, thrown off-kilter by an exhilarating 
    revelation starting to sink in (Hannah-Jones xvii).
